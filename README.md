- 👋 Hi, I’m @elainedueland
- 👀 I’m interested in data science for healthcare, specifically focusing on affective science, (i.e., the study of emotions).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) through the MIT and Great Learning (GL) 12-week Applied Data Science Program.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on affective science projects.
- 📫 Reach me on Slack.
